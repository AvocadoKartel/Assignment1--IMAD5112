INTRODUCTION 

The basis of this app is to help the user decide on what to eat during the day 

 

About 

My app is to be used to help decide on what food to eat depending on the time of day. It will help the user to decide quickly on what to eat. Having such an app will help users put their focus on other things instead of wasting time deciding what to eat. 

 

The app will display a suggestion (image) based on the time of day (morning, afternoon or night) you enter in the edit text. It will show breakfast, lunch or dinner suggestions depending on what time of day you enter.  

 

The app is designed to be as simple as possible in terms of user experience
